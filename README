Since the original service is down and application is not supported I have decided to release the decompilation of the .net application - 4dat forecast.

If there is some .NET developer it would be easy for him to change the provider directly in the source and recompile the application.

I am not .NET developer and I have no time to do it. 

I have also attached ilspy debugger. I used it to breakpoint the original application when it decrypted the message/debug decryption of getweather.php. It could be useful.

Have fun :-)
